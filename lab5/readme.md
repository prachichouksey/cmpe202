# Five Guys Burger
## Activity Diagram

#### The five guys behind the cash register and kitchen counter deliver the ordered burger in an orderly way.

The first guy i.e. cashier takes the order, processes the payment and prints the receipt. One receipt is given to the customer with order number who then waits for the order to be delivered. The second receipt is given to the kitchen guys.

The second guy reads the instruction, grills the bun and applies sauce on the bun.

The third guy also reads the instruction receipt and starts grilling the patty. Once grilled, places patty on bun. He then places toppings on top and passes on the burger.

The forth guy places the upper bun on top and packs the burger.

The fifth guy adds fries if any in the order and shouts out the order number.

Customer with the same order number comes and collects the order.
