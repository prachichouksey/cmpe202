# Strategy pattern using lambda

The strategy pattern is implemented in traditional as well as lambda.
The traditional code contains multiple classes to implement different discount strategies. Regular discount and Special discount are separate classes in the traditional code which are invoked from the main method as per the need.

In case of lambda, no separate classes are needed to implement the strategies for special and regular discounts. This can be implemented inside the method invocation itself using lambda expression.
